Currently, I've built two applications for increased productivity: The first is a program to inject custom metadata into vendor supplied photography. The image names are then changed to reflect our naming standards, and sent to our database for future retrieval. The second is a database of props that the studio uses. The database is built with Google Sheets and uses Google App Script to allow assoiates to reserve props."
